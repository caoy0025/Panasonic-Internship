# Panasonic-Internship

This file presents the work summary of Mr. CAO YUN in Panasonic R&D Center (Singapore) Wireless group during 2018.12-2019.04. 

In the five-month internship, I'm mainly responsible for handle 60GHz V2X road test data collected from Nanyang Technological University(NTU) and the company area. Reliability (Bandwidth) and latency data in 60GHz V2X is tested during real road driving.The specific contributions are as followed:

1)  A neural network model is applied to find the relationship among various Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) data and Singal Noise Ratio (SNR) data and then predict TCP and UDP Bandwidth. I used Tensorflow to achieve that.

2)  I used Python to process huge amounts of data collected from road test and visualize the results of comparing certain couples of meaningful data groups. 

3)  Literature survey of machine learning technique application in mmWave and 60GHz V2X is finished. 

This folder contains (all sensitive data is prevented): 
1)  Work report.
2)  All Python scripts used in data processing (Including instructions).
3)  Visible results of data comparsion.
4)  5G V2X High Reliability and Low Latency Requirenments.
